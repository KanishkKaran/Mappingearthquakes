# Critiques

Answer the following questions for each visualization.

* What is the **narrative structure**? a.k.a., how are you being led along through the information? *This is probably easiest if you quickly look at a few different ones first*
* Do you feel the information is presented in an understandable way? Why or why not?
* What kind of changes are made to the data as you progress, and what effect does that have on the story? *Additions, subtractions, change in presentation, highlights, etc.* 
* Do you like it?
